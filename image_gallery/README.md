# Simple image gallery

This project is about creating a simple image gallery. It will consist of one image zoomed in
on the top and 5 image thumbnails in the bottom (one of which corresponding to the zoomed in image).

When a thumbnail image is clicked, its bigger version appear on top.

The thumbnails bar should be made so that it accept a variable number of pictures, at most 5 per line.

The content is horizontally centered and anchored on top.
