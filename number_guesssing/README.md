# Guess the number game

This is one of the projects I'm making to learn the basics of javascript.

The outline of the project (along with a tutorial on how to implement it) can
be find here:

I tried copying all of the functionality exactly as it is, except that my
version alerts the user when an input is not as expected.

## Workings

I want you to create a simple guess the number type game. It should choose a
random number between 1 and 100, then challenge the player to guess the number
in 10 turns. After each turn the player should be told if they are right or
wrong â€” and, if they are wrong, whether the guess was too low or too high. It
should also tell the player what numbers they previously guessed. The game will
end once the player guesses correctly, or once they run out of turns. When the
game ends, the player should be given an option to start playing again.
