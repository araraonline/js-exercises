# Silly Story Generator

This is the project from [MDN][1] found here:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Silly_story_generator

## Overview

I'm being asked to get some inputs from the user and generate a somewhat random
story based on this. This is just a learning project.

An excerpt from the page:

> * Generates a silly story when the "Generate random story" button is pressed.
> * Replaces the default name "Bob" in the story with a custom name, only if a custom name is entered into the "Enter custom name" text field before the generate button is pressed.
> * Converts the default US weight and temperature quantities and units in the story into UK equivalents if the UK radio button is checked before the generate button is pressed.
> * Will generate another random silly story if you press the button again (and again...)
